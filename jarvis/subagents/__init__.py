"""Parallel subagents: the lead agent splits a big task into 1–6 briefs and
``spawn_agents`` runs them at the same time, each with its own conversation
and tools, returning their reports in one tool result.

- ``team``    — live state (Team / AgentRun), snapshots, stop, registry (UI-free)
- ``runner``  — one agent's model ↔ tool loop on its own thread
- ``tool``    — the ``spawn_agents`` tool, its schema, settings, result text
- ``context`` — which agent the current thread works for (import-free)
