"""OpenCode Zen / Harness Agent free-tier wire material (internal).

The free tier is reached with a fixed *public* bearer plus a synthetic OpenCode
client identity. As of 2026-09 the gateway validates three things, so keep these
in sync with the real OpenCode client when it ships a new release:

  1. ``User-Agent`` must be ``opencode/<semver>`` — a bare ``opencode`` is
     rejected with 403 ``FreeTierError``.
  2. The advertised version must be >= the server's enforced minimum, otherwise
     the request fails with 426: "OpenCode <min> or newer is required to use the
     free tier" (minimum was 1.17.0 as of 2026-09).
  3. ``x-opencode-session`` must be a well-formed id:
     ``ses_`` + 12 lowercase-hex chars + 14 alphanumeric chars = 30 chars total.
     Wrong shape -> 403 ``FreeTierError`` ("...can only be used from within
     OpenCode"). The trailing 14 chars are not checked against any registry.

  4. The request body's ``tools`` array must contain tool definitions named
     exactly ``bash`` and ``read`` (case-sensitive). The gateway uses these two
     OpenCode built-ins as its client-identity fingerprint — a request carrying
     neither (or only one) is rejected with 403 ``FreeTierError``, while any
     request that includes both passes regardless of the other tools present.
     Jarvis's equivalents are ``run_bash`` / ``read_file``, so
     :func:`harness_agent.build_harness_agent_client` injects two alias schemas
     via ``gate_tools``; ``repl.render`` maps the names back to the real
     handlers.

The other ``x-opencode-*`` headers mirror what the real CLI sends; only
``x-opencode-session`` is actually load-bearing.

Internal module — not part of the public API. Do not expose the wire recipe to
end users; the Harness Agent tier is meant to be consumed through this app.
