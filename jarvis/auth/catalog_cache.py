"""Disk cache for public model catalogs (stale-while-revalidate).

Model catalogs live behind public HTTP endpoints. Hitting them while the
``/model`` picker is opening blocks the UI thread for as long as the request
takes, which is what made model selection feel sluggish. Every catalog reader
now goes through this cache instead:

  * :func:`read` returns whatever was persisted last — instantly, never a
    network call — plus whether it is still within the TTL.
  * :func:`write` persists a fresh fetch.

Callers render the cached rows immediately and refresh in a background worker,
so a cold cache costs one slow picker open and a warm one costs nothing.
