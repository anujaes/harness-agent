"""What a request actually sends for thinking — and what to do when it's refused.

``state.think_mode`` / ``state.think_effort`` are the *preference* (what the user
picked, kept across model switches). :func:`effective` turns that preference into
what the current model can take, using :mod:`jarvis.auth.thinking_caps`:
an unsupported level becomes the nearest supported one, a model that can't be
switched off stays on at its lowest level, a model that doesn't think is sent
nothing. :func:`apply` writes that onto the request kwargs for every provider
(one place, shared by the main turn and subagents), and :func:`recover` handles
a provider that refuses the thinking settings anyway: it remembers the refusal
and says what to resend, so the turn goes on instead of failing.

Nothing here raises into the request path — any failure falls back to the old,
unclamped behaviour.
