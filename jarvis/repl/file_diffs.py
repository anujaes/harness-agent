"""Inline, real-time unified diffs for file create/edit tools.

When ``write_file`` / ``edit_file`` / ``multi_edit`` change a file, the tool
handlers call :func:`emit_file_diff` so the user sees exactly what changed,
rendered as a color-coded diff panel in the transcript the moment the write
lands. The shared ``console`` is thread-safe in the TUI (writes are marshalled
to the main thread) and prints directly in the legacy Rich REPL, so the same
call works in both front-ends.
